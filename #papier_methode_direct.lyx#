\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neutron density in nuclear system is subject to fluctuations that arise
 from nuclear random process.
 For sub-critical systems with large number of neutrons these fluctuations
 are usually small enough so that the well known Boltzmann equation is valid
 and the system is correctly described by mean quantities.
 This is no more true with a law neutron density that implies predominantly
 neutron fluctuations over average values obliging the use of other techniques
 to correctly describe the neutron population.
 Among them, the Neutron Multiplicity Counting (NMC) methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NMC Ensslin,NMC Robba"

\end_inset

 focus on correlated time neutrons (i.e.
 neutrons belonging to the same fission chain) detections for sub-critical
 system using mean single count rate (i.e.
 mean count rate of detection), double count rate (i.e.
 mean count rate of time correlated pairs of detections), triple count rate
 (i.e.
 mean count rate of time correlated triples of detections), etc.
 In this way NMC is based on higher-order moment of the counting distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually NMC values obtained by simulation are calculated with algorithms
 very similar to those used with real detectors and therefore only make
 use of detection times.
 Depending on the simulation tools, the calculation of these values is performed
 directly inside the simulation code or outside 
\emph on
via
\emph default
 output files (List-mode like) and post-processing programs.
 This approach is referred here to as the 
\emph on
analog method.

\emph default
 As this method require exact simulation of the transport of neutrons, i.e.
 analog calculation, classical Monte Carlo techniques for variance reduction
 (Russian roulette, splitting etc.), which only preserve first order moment
 (mean quantities), cannot be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence and although dating back to the early nuclear era, the
 use and study of NMC techniques has been for many years limited by the
 performance of computers that struggled to simulate the entire neutron
 population of an experiment.
 Thanks to modern computers a number of barriers have been raised and these
 techniques are now regularly used for the reactivity assessment of low
 power ADS reactors, non-destructive assay of special nuclear material,
 sub-critical benchmarks

\end_inset

, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, NMC simulations can still be very CPU time consuming under certain
 circumstances such as configurations with huge calculation time for neutron
 transport or when NMC values with large time scale are required.
 Some methods have been developped to solve this problem such as variance
 reduction techniques

 or sensitivities estimation throw eigen values calculations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This paper proposes another approach based on the use of analog simulation
 tools taking advantage of an additional information provided by the code
 : the fission chain identifier (or history identifier) to which a detection
 belongs.
 This information makes it possible to identify the correlated detections,
 i.e.
 resulting from the same fission chain.
 This approach will be referred to the 
\emph on
direct method.
 
\emph default
The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 This paper focuses on the calculation of the single counting rate, the
 double counting rate and the so called Feynman-Y curve

 in order to keep consisteing with the 
\emph on
direct method
\emph default
 formalism in the next section.
 During an NMC simulation, neutron detections are time-tagged and stored
 into a file creating the so called 
\emph on
signal
\emph default
 (which therefore contains a set of detection times).
 In a second step, the post processing divid this 
\emph on
signal
\emph default
 into equal samples of width 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 For each of them the number of events are counted and binned into a histogram
 called the Feynman histogram.
 This histogram therefore represents the occurrence probabilities of various
 multiplets (i.e., 1 detection, 2 detections, etc.) occurring within a specified
 samples width 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Several methods exist to split the signal, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the construction of the Feynman histogram with consecutive samples.

From these the

\end_inset

 values representing the number of times 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 detections are found in samples are deduced.
 This can be repeated for multiple samples widths resulting in multiple
 Feynman histograms.
 The NMC values are finally calculated with the following formulas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{1}(\tau)=\frac{\underset{k}{\sum}k\,c_{k}(\tau)}{\underset{k}{\sum}c_{k}(\tau)}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y(\tau)=2\times\frac{Y_{2}(\tau)}{Y_{1}(\tau)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

Where 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{2}$
\end_inset

 stand for the single and double counting rates for samples of width 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}$
\end_inset

 being the first two reduced factorial moments as expressed in the Hage-Cifarell
i formalism.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is the Feynman-Y value also equal to the ratio of the variance to the mean
 in the number of neutron detections in samples of width 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 minus unity : 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(\tau)=\frac{Var\left(C_{k}(\tau)\right)}{Mean\left(C_{k}(\tau)\right)}-1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{1}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is simply the count rate, his value should remain constant regardless the
 samples width value (as long as it is sufficiently large to avoid statistical
 effect) and equal to a named value 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Changing 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 allows to adjust the amount of detections coming from the same fission
 chains (i.e.
 correlated detections) taken into account.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 tends towards zero the probability of having correlated detections also
 tends towards zero as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{2}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 increases, more and more correlated detections are taken into account leading
 to an increase of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{2}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 At first only correlated detections from prompt neutrons are taken into
 account, then from all neutrons (prompt + delayed).
 This is shown by the presence of two plateaus on the Feynman curve.
 Further increase of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 do not add more correlated detection and both 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{2}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(\tau)$
\end_inset

 tend to their asymptotic values respectively named 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{2}$

In order to reduce uncertainties the number of samples used must be large
 (often several thousand).
 If one want to cover delayed neutron, large samples are required (at least
 100 seconds) and the simulated signal can required unacceptable CPU time
 or experiment duration.
 As a consequence, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 are in practice estimated throw formulas depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{2}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(\tau)$
\end_inset

, making these values dependent of both the samples width (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{2}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{\infty}(\tau)$
\end_inset

) and the underlying theory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin{align}
R_{2}(\tau) & =\frac{1}{\omega(\tau)}\,Y_{2}(\tau)\label{eq:R2_omega}\\

\end{align}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the inverse of the neutron lifetime which includes slowing-down time
 in the detector.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that for the NMC values to be meaningful and usable for other measures
 (calculation of total multiplication for instance), the experiment must
 be in a steady state, i.e.
 the power remains constant over time.

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 be the mean rate of source events (i.e.
 the mean number of histories per time unit) and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{N}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

the probability for an history to create 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 detections.
 Both values comes from simulation results.
 In particular, the association of each detection with the fission chain
 identifier makes it possible to calculate the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{N}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

quantity.
 That being said, for a stationary process the mean rate of detections from
 histories creating 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 detections is 
\begin_inset Formula $S\cdot p_{N}\cdot C_{N}^{1}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 denotes the binomial coefficient.
 Summing over all possible numbers of detections gives the single rate of
 detections:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathring{Y}_{1}=S\sum_{N=1}^{\infty}p_{N}\cdot C_{N}^{1}\label{eq:y1_final}

 Considering the mean rate of correlated pairs triggered by the

We are now interested in the calculation of the non-asymptotic value of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathring{R}_{2}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathring{Y}_{2}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 Let's consider a first detection in the time range 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[t_{1},t_{1}+dt_{1}\right]$
\end_inset

 and a second one inside 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[t_{2},t_{2}+dt_{2}\right]$

\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}<t_{2}$
\end_inset

, the average number of correlated pairs of detections 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{r}$
\end_inset

 between two correlated detections distant of 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}-t_{1}$
\end_inset

 is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q_{r}(t_{2}-t_{1})\,dt_{1}\cdot dt_{2}=\mathring{R}_{2}\cdot pdf(t_{2}-t_{1})\,dt_{1}\cdot dt_{2}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[t_{2},t_{2}+dt_{2}\right]$

 Let us now define a function

 As

The above reasoning does not differentiate between sources.
 For instance, if histories are created by both spontaneous fissions and

 combines these two types of sources.
 However, for practical reasons it is sometimes interesting to differentiate
 sources in simulations: one may perform a set of simulations with only
 spontaneous fission sources and another set of simulations with only 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\alpha-n\right)$
\end_inset

 sources in order to later adjust the proportion of one source type to the
 other.
 Since each of these sources creates histories which are independent from
 each other, Equations

General procedure for the calculation of NMC values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general procedure used in this paper for the calculation of NMC values
 with the 
\emph on
analog method
\emph default
 is as follow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Step 1: A simulation is performed considering both types of neutron sources
 (spontaneous fissions and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\alpha-n\right)$
\end_inset

 reactions) and imposing that all histories start (i.e.
 the instant of the source event) at t = 0 second.
 The number of source events to be simulated must be sufficient for the
 duration of the desired signal.
 For each neutron detection in the two NOMAD detectors, the following informatio
n is recorded: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the type of source from which the neutron originated,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the detection time,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the history identifier.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The calculation has been performed using the version 6 of MORET - based
 on MORET
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

5 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MORET"

\end_inset

 - which allows the analog simulation of neutrons and the record of simulation
 information into list-mode like files.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Step 2: From the output file is extracted for each type of source a number
 of histories corresponding to the desired signal duration and the intensity
 of each source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Step 3: The beginning of each histories (and therefore the corresponding
 detection times) are modified by sampling from a uniform random law over
 the choosen signal duration interval.
 Some histories may start close enough to the end of the signal so that
 their detection times can appear beyond the chosen signal duration.
 To solve this, the modulo function of parameter the signal duration is
 applied on each detection time to confine the detection times to the desired
 time interval.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Step 4: All detection times are merged to form the final signal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Step 5: Other post-processing can be applied to simulate experimental instrument
ation behavior such as the detectors dead-time or the detectors time resolution.
 For this present work no experimental instrumentation effect is taken into
 account since the 
\emph on
direct method 
\emph default
cannot handle them for the time beeing and this step is skipped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Step 6: NMC values are calculated using post processing programs as for
 a signal originating from real detectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is several benefits to this approach for the 
\emph on
analog method
\emph default
.
 First, the simulation of the transport of one history is an independent
 process from the transport of other histories.
 Therefore, this approach does not necessarily require a parallelized computatio
n code and it is sufficient to run several instances of the computation
 code, taking care to modify the seed of the random generator.
 Secondly, it is possible to adjust the parameters used in post-processing
 (sources intensities, sources types, signal duration) to build a new signal
 without having to recalculate the transport part whose calculation time
 is much longer than that of the post-processing part.
 Another interesting point is the possibility to change the seed used to
 sample the beginning time of the histories (step 3).
 One can then create multiple signals that all contain the same knowledge
 (i.e.
 fission chains, detections, etc.) but distributed differently (although
 the uniform random law is still used).
 This allows the study of statistical properties (expected mean and standard
 deviation) of observable calculated from these signals.

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the 
\emph on
direct method
\emph default
 the post processing program only needs the result of the first step for
 the calculation of the two required terms 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{N}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $pdf(t)$
\end_inset

.
 Since each recorded detection has been associated to its corresponding
 history identifier the calculation of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{N}$
\end_inset

 is straightforward.
 The calculation of 
\begin_inset Formula $pdf(t)$
\end_inset

, must be done taking into account all the combination of detections originating
 from a history as illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It is important that the binning used to calculate

 is fine and cover a large time range in order to include both prompt and
 delayed neutrons.

A possible way to make the comparison feasible for larger samples widths
 is to lengthen the simulated signal duration by performing additional simulatio
ns.
 This methodology is in practice inaccessible for desktop computers due
 to the high CPU time consuming (we are speaking of orders of magnitude
 longer simulation duration).
 Another approach is to create a number of independent signals by changing
 the seed as explained before.
 The results of this method is presented in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Although the previous figures tend to show consistency between the two methods,
 the delayed neutron part of the Feynman curve could not be compared.
 To access this portion another approach must be used.
 By reducing the intensity of the neutron sources it is possible to artificially
 lengthen the signal duration for the same number of simulated histories.
 It should be noted that this method does not require additional simulation
 (neutron transport), as the signal broadening is performed with post-processing
 functions.
 In this way, a new set of 100 signals have been generated with a duration
 equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $5.5\cdot10^{6}$

 seconds (about 64 days) corresponding to a source composed of 128.5 SF per

 The samples width is equal to

 variance as the analog method using about 0.1% of the total simulated histories.
 It has to be noted that this gain depends on many parameters which are
 not presented here due to the lack of theoretical formula of the direct
 method's variance.
 Nevertheless it is obvious that this gain increase with the intensity of
 the signal since the fission chains tends to overlap more and more.

Conclusion and future work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditionally, NMC values are calculated using similar tools to exploit
 the detections obtained by the experiment's detectors or by simulation.
 However, in some cases this approach can be very CPU intensive.
 The 
\emph on
direct method
\emph default
 uses additional information provided by the simulations to significantly
 reduce uncertainties and thus simulation times.
 However, as the present situation stands, this method cannot completely
 replace the traditional method.
 The main identified limitations are the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
requirement of sub-critical system in a steady state (i.e.
 constant power with time);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
detector dead time not take into account;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
higher order of counting rates (triple, etc.) are not yet derive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concerning the last point, it should be noted that these values are often
 difficult to obtain by simulation due to the need of a high detection efficienc
y to keep the variance reasonable.
 Therefore the development of the calculation of this value with the 
\emph on
direct method
\emph default
 could be very advantageous for applications that use these types of measures.
